Second version of my big Android Studio project I made in 2019. I changed the design completely, created an Authentication System using Google Authenticate. I also used Real Time Database to store all related data.
Sellers can add their products, show their products to customers, control their list of products, see orders, check the discount suggested by app. Customers can order products, call sellers, search for products and stores.
